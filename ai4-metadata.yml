title: Conus species classifier
summary: Classify conus images among 70 species.
description: |-
  Citizen science has become a powerful force for scientific inquiry, providing researchers with access to a vast array of data points while connecting non scientists to the real process of science. This citizen-researcher relationship creates a very interesting synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis of research projects. 
  With this in mind, a Convolutional Neural Network has been trained to identify conus marine snails at species level [1] in collaboration with the [Natural Science Museum of Madrid](http://www.mncn.csic.es/). The taxonomy of these snails has changed significantly several times during recent years and the introduction of Deep Learning techniques allowing to classify them is a very valuable tool for the experts.
  This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for conus identification using images. The architecture used is an Xception [2] network using Keras on top of Tensorflow.
  The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with the top 5 predictions.
  The training dataset has been provided by the [Natural Science Museum of Madrid](http://www.mncn.csic.es/) and it consists on a dataset containing images of 68 species of conus covering three different regions: the Panamic region; the South African region; and the Western Atlantic and Mediterranean region.

  This service is based in the [Image Classification with Tensorflow](./deep-oc-image-classification-tensorflow.html) model.
